Please add the required JARs from the lib folder into the project library. Otherwise, the program will cause an error due to unresolved packages/classes.

If you are running the project for the first time, please log in as root manager with the credentials:
Email: root@email.com
Password: 123
This allows you to start creating your own employees (staffs, doctors), whose records will be stored in the respective text files that were created inside the data folder during your first run.

If you are not a root manager, and you are logging in into your account (if exists) for the first time, the password is exactly the same as your email.
